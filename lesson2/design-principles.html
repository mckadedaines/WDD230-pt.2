          I believe the New World website is a great example of Visual Hierarchy
          because it shows you what is most important on the page and it makes
          it known to the viewer. The website shows you the game and what ever
          major event is going on at the time.

          I think Steams store is an example of Hick's Law. I think a lot of
          websites that have items you can purchase follow the same rule. The
          more things the user can look at and pick from the longer they are to
          stay on the page, and companies want you to do this to intice you to
          buy their products.

          Lastly, we have Twitch.Tv which does an amazing job at controlling and
          utilizing white space and overall has a clean design. Everything looks
          smooth, and well spaced out which provides for some nice eye candy!
